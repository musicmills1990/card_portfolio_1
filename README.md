# CardPortfolio1

okay here we go!
I'm creating a program called 'The Card Shop', a basic CLI that will retreive information about the different card editions, and the
characters within each edition, pulled off of the website www.musicthegathering.com.
Some information:

-most edition have one or many characters
-characters belong to editions
-each character has a info description that the user should have access to.
-I would love if the program can list the editions based on what's available currently on the website, rather than hardwired at
5 editions, so if new additions were added, the list would update to reflect that
-I would love it if you can search for a card by typing the name of the card and finding out which edition it's in

looking at my editions to make them real:
-an edition has a name
-an edition has an image (not sure if that's usable)
-an edition has a URL

things I still need to do:

figure out why my pry and bin console isn't working
scrape and experiment with the title information to get the scrape editions method to work
go to my characters class and start adding the scraped material to change my CLI
eat food.
